# JustCook
Vuejs tool to make cooking recipes

### Install depedencies first on both server and client sides (which means you need two shells)

```
npm install
```

### On the server shell you need to run

```
npm run start
```

### On the client shell you will need to run

```
npm run dev
```

## You can now connect to localhost:8080 on your web browser to try the app


### You can also inject placeholder recipes by opening a third shell (server side) and run the seed
```
npm run seed
```
